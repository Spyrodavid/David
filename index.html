            An Actor
        </h2>


        <p>
            I've been acting since elementary school but my favorite work came during my time in college.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my sophomore year of college I Joined my schools improv comedy team Iota Eta Pie. 
            As a part of the team I performed more than 30 times and for audiences of more than 100 people. 
            I also took on a leadership role for the team and ran shows as well as team practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            This experinece has given my the opportunity to write and perform in amazing skits, short films, and plays.

           A Musician
        </h2>


        <p>
        The time I spent in college also gave me the opportunity to persue my musical interests in an amazing way.

        During my time in college I was a member of <span id="bands" class="expandable">4 bands</span> where I played trumpet, guitar, and bass guitar.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've also helped write <span id="song" class="expandable">two songs</span> for my girlfriend Sierra's band 
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6mPzd19qyGLcgbE0qJEkzX" target="_blank">Mewtone</a>.
            Unfortunately neither of those songs are recorded as of now.
